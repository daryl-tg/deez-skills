# Chart boot and the data plane

Opening `/chart/` mounts the chart engine, starts the Web Worker that owns every
websocket, and draws candles for the last-used symbol. Every other proof in this
map depends on this one working, so verify it first and never assume it.

## Sub-features

- `boot-mount` the engine mounts and the ticker bar renders.
- `boot-candles` candles reach the engine and draw.
- `boot-live` the live edge updates (price, 24h volume, open interest, funding).
- `boot-worker` the worker is alive, so websockets can open at all.

## How to get to it (user POV)

- Open `http://127.0.0.1:<lane>/chart/`. Nothing to click; the chart restores the
  last symbol (guest defaults to `BINANCE.F BTCUSDT PERP`, `1m`).

## Driving it with control-kiyotaka

Preconditions:

- `./control-kiyotaka doctor` exits zero, `chart-schema ok`, `v2 gateway reachable`.

- **Open.** Run `./control-kiyotaka browser set viewport 1440 900` then
  `./control-kiyotaka browser open "$(./control-kiyotaka url)"`.
- **Wait for data, not for time.** Poll
  `./control-kiyotaka browser eval "(()=>{const t=window.tc?.[0];return (t?.metadata?.[0]?.rawData?.length ?? 0)>50})()"`
  until it returns `true`. A cold boot with a re-optimizing vite can take ~60s.
- **Read the engine.** Run
  `./control-kiyotaka browser eval "(()=>{const t=window.tc[0];return JSON.stringify({bars:t.metadata[0].rawData.length,overlays:t.metadata.length})})()"`.
  A healthy guest boot returns ~250 bars and 4 overlays.
- **Confirm the worker is alive.** Run
  `./control-kiyotaka browser console` and assert **zero** matches for
  `Error initializing worker` and `V2StreamingConnectionUnavailable`. Either one
  present means the data plane is dead and every downstream proof is void.
- **Confirm the live edge.** Run
  `./control-kiyotaka browser eval "(()=>document.body.innerText.slice(0,300).replace(/\s+/g,' '))()"`.
  It carries the symbol, price, `24H VOLUME`, `OPEN INTEREST`, and
  `FUNDING / COUNTDOWN`. `—` in the volume/OI slots means the `/api` proxy is
  down (backend lane), not that the chart is broken.
- **Proof.** Dismiss the guest modal and capture in the same step — it re-raises:
  `./control-kiyotaka browser find role button click --name "Close"` then
  `./control-kiyotaka browser screenshot artifacts/<run>/<rev>/boot-candles.png`,
  with `./control-kiyotaka browser snapshot -i -c` saved beside it. Confirm
  nothing is on top first
  (`eval "document.querySelectorAll('[role=dialog]').length"`), then **open the
  PNG**: it must show drawn candlesticks, not a dialog. The engine read is the
  side effect; the frame is the only proof pixels arrived.

## Gotchas

- **Zero bars plus `v2 streaming websocket connection failed` is almost never the
  socket.** The worker owns the websockets, so a dead worker presents as a
  connection failure. Check `doctor`'s `chart-schema` line first: a sibling
  `orange-shared` behind this repo's pin kills `worker-impl` at module scope.
- The chart answers HTTP and mounts `window.tc` well before it has data. Asserting
  on mount alone passes on a permanently empty chart.
- Candles do **not** need the backend. `:3000` down still draws them; it only
  removes login, workspaces, volume/OI/funding, and the official catalog.
- Guest emits a benign `401`; `:3000` down adds `[refresh-token] 502` and
  `http proxy error: /api/v1/... ECONNREFUSED`. None of these are the bug.
- The canvas is WebGL and invisible to the a11y tree — a snapshot alone can never
  prove the chart drew.
