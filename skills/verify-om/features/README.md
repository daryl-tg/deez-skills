# om verification map

The maintained source for verifying user-facing behavior in the `om` daemon and
CLI. Read this index before driving, then use the matching feature file as the
recipe.

## Baseline preconditions

- Launch the lane on its **assigned** port. Bind `127.0.0.1`. Never pick a free
  one: `control-om up` (default `18101`, range `18097`–`18197`).
- `control-om doctor` reports the expected origin, an isolated lane home, a
  present dashboard bundle, and a lane that is down or yours.
- Never drive an instance this run did not start. The daemon on `31337` is the
  operator's, and it is never a target.
- A source lane is the tree **at boot**. If the repo moves under the run, doctor
  reports `lane version STALE` — relaunch before believing anything driven
  since.
- Every CLI call goes through `control-om om -- <args>`. A bare `om` writes
  the operator's home and looks identical while doing it.

## Driving conventions

- Start every recipe from a lane the run started, unless its preconditions say
  otherwise.
- Prefer ARIA roles and accessible names over CSS selectors or DOM position.
- Terminal actions run through `control-om om --` (the product) or
  `control-om cli --` (repo commands); browser actions through
  `agent-browser` against `control-om url <path>`.
- Pass `--format json` wherever it exists and assert on that, not on the text
  renderer.
- Treat every command as literal. Keep quoted names and flags unchanged.
- A lane home is disposable, so a recipe may mutate freely — but say what it
  created, and never remove proof artifacts.

## Proof and skip reporting

- Capture the user action and the resulting state, not only the final screen.
- CLI proof includes the command, stdout, stderr, and exit code.
- Mutation proof includes a read-only second view of the stored value, ideally
  on a different surface (the daemon's stream, the journal on disk, the
  dashboard table).
- Correlate surfaces on a shared id (`event_id`, watch slug) and timestamp, not
  on "both look right".
- UI proof is a **pair**: an accessibility snapshot and a screenshot, both
  showing app identity. The snapshot is diffable and survives a restyle; the
  screenshot is what a human reads.
- Publish with `control-om evidence publish <run-id> <revision>` and hand back
  the returned `8098` URL. Never an `18097`–`18197` URL.
- Report an unreachable path with the attempted command and the unmet
  precondition. Never report a skipped entry point as verified via another path.

## What a guest lane can and cannot prove

A fresh lane is signed out. It holds a machine-minted Data API key, so live
market data works; it holds no LLM credential, so every model-routed path is
out of reach. Before writing a recipe, place it on the right side of that line:

| Provable on a guest lane | Needs credentials this lane does not have |
|---|---|
| Daemon boot, health, lifecycle, logs | `om chat` and every agent turn |
| Watch CRUD, pause/resume, journals | Event-watch LLM classification, synthesis |
| Inbound ingest → fire → journal (`accept_all`) | Text signals, research studies |
| The dashboard and its RPC families | Registry publish/install, room posting |
| Market data reads (`coins`, `exchanges`, `points`) | Venue execution, wallet, orders |

## Feature entry contract

An H1 title, one paragraph of user-visible behavior, then exactly four H2s in
order: `Sub-features`, `How to get to it (user POV)`, `Driving it with
control-om`, `Gotchas`.

Keep implementation detail out. Name only user paths, stable handles, required
state, commands, and observable proof.

## Features

- [Event ingest and fire](./event-ingest-and-fire.md) — the end-to-end chain,
  provable with no credentials. Start here.
- [Daemon lifecycle and health](./daemon-lifecycle-and-health.md)
- [Watch lifecycle from the CLI](./watch-lifecycle-cli.md)
- [The ops dashboard](./ops-dashboard.md)
- [Market data reads](./market-data-reads.md)
- [Origin challenge backoff](./origin-challenge-backoff.md) — a Cloudflare
  challenge holds every source on the host, provable with a loopback stub.

Not yet mapped, and worth adding when a change touches them: the MCP
surface (`om mcp serve --stdio`), charts (`om chart`), the `om chat` TUI,
packages and the registry, and the execution/venue verbs.
